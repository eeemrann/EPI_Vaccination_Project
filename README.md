🩺 EPI Vaccination Database System

This project is a database-driven application designed to manage and monitor vaccination records under the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The system ensures secure, organized, and real-time tracking of immunization data, which can be used by healthcare authorities to streamline vaccination efforts, especially in under-served or rural areas.

🎯 Objective:

To develop a centralized digital system for recording and retrieving vaccination data for infants and children under the EPI schedule, enabling easier tracking, planning, and monitoring of immunization coverage.


🧩 Key Features:

Add/Edit/Delete child vaccination records

Stores personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Parent Info, Address

Tracks vaccines (BCG, DPT, Polio, HepB, Measles, etc.)

Automatically calculates due dates for upcoming vaccinations

Search by name, ID, or location

SQL database backend (e.g., MySQL/XAMPP)

Role-based access (Admin vs Data Entry)




🛠️ Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)

Backend: PHP or Java (depending on version)

Database: MySQL (via XAMPP or WAMP)

Optional: Leaflet.js / Google Maps API for GIS mapping


🔐 Future Enhancement (Research-Oriented):

This system is being developed further into a Blockchain-Integrated SQL Database for tamper-proof vaccination records, ensuring higher security and trust—especially useful for national and international health organizations.


🚀 How to Run:

Install XAMPP and start Apache & MySQL.

Import the SQL file into phpMyAdmin.

Place project files in htdocs directory.
